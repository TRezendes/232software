                'Stop! Chorgan -- keep perfectly still. Your life is in danger. Not only mine. My father served on the Falcon with him. I grew up on stories about Mark Jameson. It\'s worse than we suspected. The Mintakans are beginning to believe in a god -- and the one they\'ve chosen... is you. What am I still doing here, Deanna? I\'ve pushed myself hard to get this far...  ... sacrificed a lot. Mister La Forge, prepare for precision station-keeping. Run a maintenance sweep. You heard me. A collision course. Who reported to the bridge from this group? Very well... Go ahead. Negative. Anyone? Tau Cygna Five is in the de Laure belt -- heavy concentrations of hyperonic radiation. The Tamarian ship? Could some kind of damping field cause us to lose velocity? Why\'s that? Not that I disagree... Navigational sensors show we\'ve traveled sixty-five light years from our previous position. Then please do so. Beam through the hole. Locate the source of the shield, and knock it out. Okay, try it. All he wanted to know about was previous starships. What I thought was innovative on the last Enterprise or the one before that. He said he wanted to see how well we "grasped the fundamentals." We came here to help these people. Spooky.  Riker. No one has ever offered to turn you into "God?" Preserving life -- all life -- is very important to us. I\'ll form an away team. We\'re pushing away! Then they would learn nothing. Coming to heading three-four-zero mark one-zero. Doctor... Then, with your shields failing, sir... Homeless? My pleasure, sir.  Ma\'am. Prepare to take us to an orbit above those coordinates.  Captain Picard to the Bridge, please. Maybe you\'d like to feed Spot. Survey team here. And no idea what\'s causing these problems? But we weren\'t scanned by the probe. So how did this thing get aboard the Enterprise? Maybe we haven\'t made ourselves clear... Approximately three. Thanks to the equipment upgrade, we\'ll be able to complete our survey in less than twenty-four hours. Aye, sir. Or maybe "yes". Prepare to lock tractor beam. I respectfully suggest that regardless of how they did it, they are here now and they need our help. Not a word. He just got dressed and then reported for duty as if nothing had happened.  Captain, this isn\'t the first... problem I\'ve had with Worf lately. She\'d like to eliminate the possibility that one of you might be carrying some organism that was harmful to Deanna. At ease, Lieutenant! How can he leave? Correcting course... zero-two-one mark zero... If we don\'t get our command computers back on-line soon, this -- whatever this is -- won\'t matter. We\'ll all be dead. I can\'t get in. Why, Data? It\'s just a derelict. If you say so, ma\'am. Damn, you are ambitious, aren\'t you, Shelby... Look. The position of Romulan bases along the Neutral Zone... Maybe you\'re right... Worf -- you had better remain at your station. Coolant leak! How did you do this? Options? Bridge to La Forge... damage report. The man they knew as my father... the man who stands before them now... both are merely hosts. It is your task to help them understand. Deanna... Are you prepared to use them? Captain. We may not be able to get control of this situation. I recommend making arrangements to transfer all non-essential personnel to the saucer section. If we lose containment we should be prepared to separate. He wouldn\'t listen. Well, we\'re all gonna have to depend on each other to get through this, okay? This is Commander William Riker of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Identify yourself. Captain, I strongly recommend that we go to Red Alert. If the Romulans have improved their cloaking device, and we\'d be fools to think they haven\'t, we should assume a more defensive posture.
            </p>
            <p>NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS Enterprise, shuttle number five. Actually, we\'re in this sector on another mission... and you had asked Starfleet for additional dicosilium.... it seemed like a good opportunity. There\'s no time for this. Release the command codes and we\'ll talk. Uh... yes, sir.  You have my coordinates, Mister La Forge. "... still had the feeling that you wanted to stay... start to go... change your mind... " We have no wish to inconvenience you. We\'ve arranged for quarters on the planet... With all due respect, sir... I\'m not a raw cadet. I\'ve lost people on missions before.  Carmen was a good friend. But that\'s not why I\'m saying this. Shouldn\'t we assume he is alive until we know otherwise? We can\'t just abandon him. Yes... I... do... So without any regard to the risk of coming down alone... Tasha -- I\'m surprised. You mean you\'ve never heard the stories about Aldea? A wonderous mythical world -- like Atlantis on ancient earth... or Neinman on Xerxes Seven... with an advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained, peaceful, with incredible technical sophistication which provided for every citizen\'s daily needs, allowing them to devote themselves to culture and art, which was beautiful beyond compare and valued beyond price. Without knowing what he did, it\'ll be tough. Captain, we\'ve lost the link. Wes, authority and responsibility go hand in hand. I know you\'re responsible, now you have to learn to handle authority. You\'ve been put in command so you can make a few right decisions. That will establish a pattern of success and build your self-confidence. That\'s why I said this was about ego. If you don\'t trust your own judgment, you don\'t belong in the command chair. What do you recommend? Kosinski wasn\'t the one controlling the warp experiment. I\'m inclined to agree with Worf, Captain. I would limit their access while they\'re on board. They don\'t need the run of the ship. Re-establish. This doesn\'t make any sense. Why would they be trying to hit us? And if they were, why not hit us at full speed? That would be ideal. He\'s going with your recommendation, but that\'s not the point. We\'ll stay out of your way, it\'s just that we\'ve never seen a terraforming station, and couldn\'t resist the opportunity. Any passages leading to the surface? You\'ll get only one shot. Thank you. They were all in an open locker. I don\'t think he was too concerned with security. Speed being the obvious one. This ship literally thinks what it wants to do and it happens. How long... Firing second burst... Not if I weaken first. Two weeks... that\'s not enough time to explore a region that size. I thought we had five weeks. We\'re ready. A lifeform? Do you know what he meant by that? Your head is not an artifact. Perhaps, Data, just perhaps.  Thanks for following my orders so precisely, Data. Riker out. Yes.  He\'s beautiful, Deanna... just like his mother.  I don\'t think you are going to be needed here, Lieutenant. You\'re dismissed, Mister Crusher. Who\'s in charge here? Return fire, Mister Worf. Full phasers. Anything on that design, Data? That\'s an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made of sugar and spice. Boys are made of snips and snails... Mister Data, will you explain? I still have the phaser... why do I still have the phaser?
            </p>
            <p>Just got assigned this morning. Usually work downtown. No. What are you doing? Our missions are always inherently dangerous. Any of us could be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time. Stand-by phasers and photon torpedoes. And that transmission -- Yes.  He\'s beautiful, Deanna... just like his mother.  I don\'t think you are going to be needed here, Lieutenant. Doctor Crusher\'s got a handle on it, Geordi. You\'d be the first person she\'d call... There\'s a chance our doctors can do something... Captain Picard, this is the Enterprise, sir... Miridian Six... near the Neutral Zone? I thought it was uninhabited... I wish I had an answer, Captain. The truth is... I\'m not sure. Oh, it\'s just a toy I was taking home... a present... And for the Ornarans -- without the medicine they would all die. Really? Are we still docked on the starbase? Because of a man you once knew... Penthor-Mul. I\'m Commander William Riker from the starship Enterprise. There must be a better way than this to deal with it. Neutral. And uninvolved, sir, in virtually all interstellar matters of consequence. Fairness?! You disrupt this ship -- kidnap the captain! An epidermal mold, I\'d guess. Made to give your exterior the desired finish. But it weakened him in some way, leading to the incredible jump out here. It\'s all right, sir, I\'ll see he leaves immediately... Standard orbit. -- Because it\'s polite, Data. Please. Bring my people here. Music lessons. Ensign Gibson, warp eight point eight. That can certainly wait until we\'ve recovered the survivors. Aye, sir. I\'ll do the best I can. Any signs of life, Mister La Forge? Maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems. Then suppose we treat them like children. Let\'s do it. I feel... terrible. But thanks to you, I\'m much better now. And I feel confident that when I leave, I\'ll be ready to take my place in society again. I could have set up the rendezvous in a dozen alternate sites. Alexander! Nothing I\'ve been invited to. Have any of you? Forty five point three hours, sir. Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you. Engineering, prepare to extend shields... On screen. We\'re meeting in the Observation lounge at fourteen hundred hours to draw up a mission plan. I\'ll take that chance. Ladies and Gentlemen. It won\'t get any easier tomorrow. There\'s a good chance we can retrieve the database from one of the consoles inside the station. Affirmative. The only way we can wind up in the same starfield is if you bring us out of warp speed at precisely the same instant as the Lantree. I don\'t think this is a random occurrence. There is a purpose here -- a reason. What, I don\'t know. Just positive ones sir. I\'ve already welcomed Ensign Mendon on board and he certainly seems eager to please. How do we do that? Our computer banks are non-negotiable. Have we got a fix on her? There hasn\'t been a Daedalus class in service for... what... ? Guess there\'s only one thing to do. We\'ve got to make some new memories... What do you mean? I\'m glad we got you back, Geordi... If you\'ll check your reports, you\'ll find that two of the colonists didn\'t survive. The Alliance? Anything you want to talk about, Geordi? Did you copy that, Geordi? This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything. It\'s quite a sight. I\'m trying. You need a bigger head. Excuse us, Ambassador. Worf! They\'re ignoring us! Hold on that. There may be another way. I\'ll keep you informed. Worf, I\'ll need that rendezvous schedule sent over to Commander Rudman on the Merrimac as soon as you -- I wonder what the hell they were doing in a Federation sector. A lost survey ship would be my guess. A dozen or so survivors at most. This method of attrition could take a little getting used to. All yours. I\'d rather let the captain handle that. Who asks the question? What do you need, "Q"? In my opinion, we have no choice, sir. Initiate auto-destruct? I don\'t know. One could get the feeling they don\'t exactly trust us. Then we\'ll stay put right here until the Enterprise finds us...  Data, run an inventory of what\'s still usable inside the shuttle. The particle stream will tear apart human flesh as well, that option is not acceptable. Yes... but this is still moving. Worf, there have to be other options. Captain -- Data is coming down to join you. Any life signs? Acknowledged, Enterprise-C. Captain Picard is safely aboard...  Fire phasers. We spent some time together. Not very well. We just need to tie in Geordi\'s atmospheric sensors. Enterprise?... Enterprise?... Fascinating woman. We came here to help these people. Terrified... ? I don\'t need explanations. I think we\'ll be safe in here. I\'m not sure about our air supply. Stay put and don\'t move around, don\'t expend unnecessary energy. With any luck we can wait this out. They\'re ignoring us! Set coordinates for the Neutral Zone, Mister Data. We have a call to pay on the Romulans. Data, do we have the telemetry link back? She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch have been fugitives for years. I suspect he\'s pretty good at evading capture. As cold as it sounds we\'re going to have to treat this mission as if it never happened. Everything will remain exactly as it was before we arrived.</p>
            <p>Mister Worf, will that interference affect the Transporter Beam? Negative, not enough room, sir. It seems to be trying to keep us away from the shuttle. What\'s the latest on the Enterprise\'s medical situation? A ship that was almost the Yamato, existing in a "hole in space," no crew aboard -- what\'s the purpose? As fast as you tracked down that faulty processing accelerator? Three hundred years ago.  Then there probably aren\'t any life signs? Best poker face I\'ve ever seen. You wanted to see me, Sir? Fine. One of your people, then. Isn\'t it? Data may be the issue, but our performances are what will be judged. As soon as it\'s convenient Captain, I insist on a meeting with you and your staff. The specialty of the house, Alaskan stew. I\'ll pass that along to the crew, Captain. I\'ve reviewed Barclay\'s psychological profile. He\'s always had seclusive tendencies... it was noted at the Academy more than once... Is that possible? You\'re not Minuet. I know you\'re on vacation. You\'ll probably want to sleep late, and go to the holodeck. But if you\'d like to help out, we could use an extra hand in preparing for the Phoenix Cluster survey. Then suppose we treat them like children. We could use our phasers like a scalpel... There it is. And the other one -- his assistant? You will lead it? Let\'s go. Does the Captain understand what you and Geordi reported about those weapons? They\'re razor sharp, split-second lethal... Set phasers on stun. Captain, are you on the bridge? Terrific. Transporter Room, have you got a lock on us? In time for what... ? We understand. In fact, your system of law and punishment may be better than many we once had.  But he has laws he must obey too. And one of them says he must protect his people from harm. I\'ve been offered my own command, something I\'ve trained for... Then let\'s get to it. It\'s no wonder you have one, with all this going on, sir.  Try to relax. I\'ve got things in hand. We\'ve no time for courtesy!  Get those damned control chips back in place, Data! In the correct order! Transporter room three, can you get a pattern lock on Commander Data, Counselor Troi and Chief O\'Brien in Ten Forward... ? Transporter Room proceed with Beaming Operation. I\'m on my way. I don\'t blame you.  Not the most luxurious accommodations Starfleet has to offer... Standby!  Stay here and cover La Forge. But if that causes you pain... I will suppress it. I will keep my distance, Doctor Beverly. I would never hurt you. Lethal? Helm, get us out of here! You have orders for me, sir? Shields up. Just a game. Mister La Forge, Doctor -- they\'ll be at their destination in less than a minute... I accept the risk. Amazing. I never thought I would ever see a Romulan ship -- not this close. I find them very much as we were a few hundred years ago... but with the technology we have now. They\'re very dangerous... We\'ve only got three days. Without working transporters, we couldn\'t have them out in time. And risk a war? I have my father to thank for that. I hope it\'s complete. Much of my decision will be based on it. But that means... Uhnari\'s now a coalescent. That\'s why the transporter\'s biofilters couldn\'t extract them. Check your data banks on humor... subheading "Slapstick"... Mister La Forge... start working on the problem. You look strange, Paul... You\'re so beautiful... I guess everybody perceives time a little differently... it depends on the exact situation... how you\'re feeling... We\'re pushing away! All right... then why don\'t you give me the overview of your research while Mister La Forge and your assistant look at the experimental data... No, I\'ll handle this. I\'ve had it with him. Yes. Captain. Or maybe "yes". Spread out... twenty five meter radius... our window back closes in nine minutes... Well... this is what we came here for.  Captain, we are entering the structure. What does that mean? The only thing that\'s changed is you. How do you know? What he means is, what planet is this? Similar conditions. </p><p>They were monitoring a planet that was breaking up, not a collapsing star as in this case, but there were the same huge shifts in gravity... If you bring happiness into Deanna\'s life, nothing would please me more. You\'re not really a bad sort, Ral, you just don\'t have any values... beyond the value of today\'s bid, that is. She\'s just the one to give some meaning to your sorry existence... if you\'re smart enough to take it. I doubt that you are. Cover the ship as planned. Move out. Thirteen-sixty-five-baker. That should put us near shuttlebay two. Riker to Engineering... what\'s going on down there? You mean, maybe we\'ve come into this room, sat at this table and had this conversation a dozen times already? What is it, Wes? No, just my cards... Which is the least painful to our crew? Move to it quickly? Or take time to prepare for it thoroughly? Got to earn them first. Fire! Sounds pretty routine. Whoever they are, they\'re in a big hurry to get here. Which raises the question of how to get Junior off the hull when we get there... I hope your profit margin is pretty high on this little adventure, Lurin... because you\'re risking war with the Federation. Better than prison. Ensign, there are officers who wait years to serve aboard this... You don\'t know what it is? Enterprise, extend shields! But this is not a time for change. I need you all where you are, where Captain Picard always relied on you.  I have been... reluctantly... forced to conclude that Commander Shelby, our expert on the Borg, is the ideal choice at this time for first officer. Or I, that women are. That\'s why I can be here with you while the women on the away team go to find Ramsey. I can\'t accept that. Let\'s get in position. What\'s in the case? Correcting course... zero-two-one mark zero... Aye, sir. We will make all preparations.  Commander Data, return to the Enterprise -- immediately. Why? Because I\'m only a man? I know you are a computer-generated image... but your smell, the way you feel, your touch, even the way you talk and think is so real. They must not know I\'m taking medication... I thought I had. We have to find a way to reach him... we must know what he knows... Sensors at maximum sensitivity. Set for stun! It\'s your Persian Flaw. I\'ll form an away team. One thousand, fourteen. Actually it was quite a bargain, Kazago. I thought the Ferengi always made a profit on things. Not these dreams. Sir... ? Halt.'
